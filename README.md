# VoyageFlow — Interactive Travel Experience Simulator

This project follows the requested structure: a single HTML file (`index.html`) that simulates a 4-page flow by showing/hiding page containers, plus separate `style.css` and `script.js`.

## Files
- `index.html` — contains all four page sections (Registration, Travel Blog, Price Calculator, Confirmation).
- `style.css` — styles and transitions (fade/slide).
- `script.js` — validation, modal handling, page navigation, price calculation.
- `README.md` — this file.

## Notes
- No alerts or confirm dialogs; modals are custom HTML/CSS.
- All data is static and client-side only.
